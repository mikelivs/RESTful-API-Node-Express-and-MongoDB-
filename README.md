# RESTful API Using Node.js, Express and MongoDB
 
RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service -- is based on representational state transfer (REST) technology, an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

NODE.jS
---------
Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine).

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.

I/O bound Applications

Data Streaming Applications

Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)

JSON APIs based Applications

Single Page Applications

It is not advisable to use Node.js for CPU intensive applications.

Express 3.x is a light-weight web application framework to help organize your web application into an MVC architecture on the server side.

Then use a database like MongoDB with Mongoose (for modeling) to provide a backend for your Node.js application. Express.js basically helps you manage everything, from routes, to handling requests and views.
